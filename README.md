# fonts
all the credit goes to the https://www.blackmoreops.com for providing some sources of fonts
i have added more than 135 fonts which install more then 135 fonts including some mathmetical formulas also
how to run the program ??????????????
at first open terminal and run command 
git clone https://github.com/uralic/fonts
after completion of cloning then run command 
cd fonts
then provide the required permission to the program as
chmod +x fonts.sh
now you can  install program as 
./fonts.sh
it will automatically install all the available fonts to your linux system
since after completion of installation process the system will reboot automatically and all the fonts start works properly
so don't get panic and enjoy
enjoy !!!!!!!!!
